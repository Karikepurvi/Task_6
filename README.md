Hi! This is my submission for Task 6 of the Data Analyst Internship – focusing on analyzing **monthly revenue** and **order volume** using SQL aggregation techniques.

The dataset used is the popular **Sample - Superstore** dataset. The analysis was done in **Google Colab** using **SQLite** and **Pandas**.

##  Key SQL Concepts Used
- SUM(sales) – to calculate monthly revenue
- COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) – to count unique orders
- strftime('%Y', order_date) – to extract year
- GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT – for sorting and filtering

  #  Tools & Libraries
- Google Colab
- Python (Pandas, SQLite3)
- CSV file: Sample - Superstore.csv

  Thank you for reviewing!
